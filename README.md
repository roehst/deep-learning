# Deep Learning

My implementation of neural networks, following the wonderful Deep Learning from Scratch book (available at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-from/9781492041405/).

Right now, it provides only very basic functionality:
- Dense layers
- Linear and sigmoid activations
- SGD optimization
- Backprop
